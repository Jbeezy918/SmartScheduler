>

## Objection Handling

### "We're happy with our current system"
**Response:** "That's great! What are you using now? [Listen] The main difference with SmartScheduler is the AI - it learns your booking patterns and optimizes your schedule automatically. Most customers save 15+ hours per week. Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if it could work better for you?"

### "Too expensive"
**Response:** "I understand. Let me show you the math: If you save just 1 hour per week at $25/hour, that's $100/month - already pays for itself. Plus you'll see fewer no-shows and more bookings. What if we started with the $49 Starter plan for your first month?"

### "We need to think about it"
**Response:** "Absolutely! What specific questions can I answer? [Listen] Why don't you try the free 14-day trial? No credit card needed. You can see the exact time and revenue impact on your business before spending a dime."

### "Seems complicated to set up"
**Response:** "Actually the opposite - most customers are fully set up in under 20 minutes. We have free onboarding where we walk you through everything. Plus your first appointment bookings can start same-day."

## Close Strategies
